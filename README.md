# world_income_inequality
This is a group project.

It analyses the GDP for different regions and countries.
Inequality is measured in terms of the Gini Index-
  Higher the gini index, greater the inequality
  Subsequently, smaller the gini index, greater the equality

Here Inequality means that the rich get richer and the growth is not equal for all the groups of the region.

I particularly worked on the **forecasting part** of the project.
I tested 
  1. VAR
  2. LSTM
  3. Random Forest with Lag Features
on the data set.

The VAR Model worked the best as the data was a time series data with relationships/dependencies between columns.

Used Visualization Techniques for visualizing the forecasting results.
